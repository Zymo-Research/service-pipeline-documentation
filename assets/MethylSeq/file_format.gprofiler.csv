Column,Description
query,"A label for the input query, in the format *group1_vs_group2*. The value is constant in each file."
significant,"*TRUE* if the enrichment of input genes in the functional term (see columns *term_id* and *term_name*) is significant; otherwise *FALSE*."
p_value,"Hypergeometric p-value after correction for multiple testing. More on the statistical tests at [here](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/page/docs#significance_threhshold)".
term_size,"The number of all genes that are annotated to the functional term in the annotation source (see the column *source*)."
query_size,"The number of input genes that are associated with at least one functional term in the annotation source (see the column *source*). This value is constant for each annotation source for a given analysis, e.g., all genes overlapped with the DMRs detected from a group comparison."
intersection_size,"The number of input genes annotated to the term in each row, i.e., the overlap between the genes in input and all the genes annotated to the functional term."
precision,"The ratio between intersected genes (both in query and annotated to the term) and the total query, i.e., *intersection_size/query_size*."
recall,"The ratio between intersected genes (both in query and annotated to the term) and all the genes annotated to the functional term in the annotation source, i.e., *intersection_size/term_size*."
term_id,"Unique identifier for the functional term in each row, e.g GO:0005005."
source,"Abbreviated name for the annotation source, e.g., GO:BP for GeneOntology:biological_process."
term_name,"The short name of the functional term."
effective_domain_size,"The total number of all genes annotated in the source domain genomewide. E.g., all the human genes annotated in GO:BP."
source_order,"The numeric order for the term within its source domain, relevant to the positions in the Manhattan plot."
parents,"A list of term IDs (separated by '|') that are direct parents of the term, and an artificial root node for non-hierarchical data."
