Column,Description
query,"A label for input query. The value is the same for one set of DMRs."
significant,"*TRUE* if the functional enrichment is significant; otherwise *FALSE*."
p_value,"Hypergeometric p-value after correction for multiple testing".
term_size,"The number of genes that are annotated to the functional term genomewide."
query_size,"The number of input genes, should be constant for an analysis."
intersection_size,"The number of input genes annotated to the term."
precision,"The proportion of genes in the input list that are annotated to the term, i.e., *intersection_size/query_size*."
recall,"The proportion of genes in the term that the query recovers, i.e., *intersection_size/term_size*."
term_id,"Unique term identifier, e.g GO:0005005."
source,"Abbreviated source name for the term, e.g., GO:BP."
term_name,"Short name of the functional term."
effective_domain_size,"The total number of genes annotated in the source domain. E.g., all the genes annotated in GO:BP."
source_order,"The numeric order for the term within its source domain."
parents,"A list of term IDs that are hierarchically directly above the term. For non-hierarchical data sources this points to an artificial root node."
