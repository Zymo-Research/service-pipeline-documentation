Column,Description
chr,Chromosome name of the DMC
pos,"Chromosomal position of the DMC. 1-based. For a CpG, this position always refers to the C on the plus strand."
group1Mean,"The mean of methylation values for group 1 samples. For DSS-based output, these values are smoothed."
group2Mean,"The same as `group1Mean`, but for group 2."
methDiff,"The difference between `group1Mean` and `group2Mean`."
diff.se,"The standard error of `methDiff`"
stat,"The statistics computed for `methDiff`."
phi1,"The estimated dispersions for group 1. Available for DSS method only."
phi2,"The estimated dispersions for group 2. Available for DSS method only."
pValue,"Raw P values"
padj,"Adjusted P values using the Benjamini & Hochberg method."
postprob.overThreshold,"The posterior probability that `methDiff` is greater than prespecified delta (default 0.1)."
<sampleId>, "The columns headed by sample Ids show the raw methylation value of each DMC in each sample."
