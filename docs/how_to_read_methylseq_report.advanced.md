## Overview of the pipeline

The report was generated with Zymo **Methylseq Advanced Analysis**
pipeline built on the [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) platform. A
example report can be found at
[here](../reports/MethylSeq_sample_report.advanced.html).

The analysis includes the following steps:

1.  Detect DMCs (differential methylated cytosines); available
    statistical methods include [Student’s
    t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test),
    [ANOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance),
    [Fisher’s exact
    test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test), and
    [DSS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DSS.html).

2.  Detect DMRs (differential methylated regions); available statistical
    methods include
    [DSS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DSS.html)
    and
    [dmrseq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dmrseq.html).

3.  Annotate both DMCs and DMRs by finding overlapped genes, promoters,
    exons, introns, and CpG islands.

4.  Functional enrichment analysis of DMR-overlapped genes by using the
    tool [g:Profiler](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost).

5.  Generate an html report with tables, figures, and downloading links.

## Report overview

This report is generated by
[diffMeth](https://github.com/Zymo-Research/diffMeth). It has a
navigation box on the left and the main results on the right. And the
results are divided into sections, including workflow summary, sample
information, DMCs and DMRs, functional enrichment analysis, and file
downloads.

<kbd style='border: 3px solid #9ecff7;'><img src="../images/MethylSeq/Advanced/00.overview.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></kbd>

## Workflow of data processing

This section provides a summary of the data analysis, including the
thresholds used for filtering input data, the tools and parameters for
analyses, and the results generated.

<kbd style='border: 3px solid #9ecff7;'><img src="../images/MethylSeq/Advanced/00.workflow.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></kbd>

## Sample information

This section provides the sample information, including sample IDs and
their associated groups.

<kbd style='border: 3px solid #9ecff7;'><img src="../images/MethylSeq/Advanced/01.sample_information.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></kbd>

## Distribution of methylation values

This section shows the distributions of methylation values for all CpGs
using the filtered data. The distributions are made at the both sample
and group levels.

The same color scheme is used in both per-sample and group-mean
distributions.

### Methylation distribution - per sample

The methylation values of all CpGs (after read depth filtering) in each
sample is presented in a [violin
plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot). The samples are
colored to distinguish different groups.

<kbd style='border: 3px solid #9ecff7;'><img src="../images/MethylSeq/Advanced/02.meth_distribution.sample.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></kbd>

### Methylation distribution - group means

The methylation values of each CpG are averaged over samples in a group
to derive group means, which are displayed in a [density
plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_estimation). Note that only
CpGs that pass the filterings in all the groups are used, and when there
are more than 5 million CpGs, the sites are down-sampled to 5 million
for computing efficiency.

<kbd style='border: 3px solid #9ecff7;'><img src="../images/MethylSeq/Advanced/03.meth_distribution.group.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></kbd>

## DMCs

DMCs, short for differential methylated cytosines, can be detected by
using various kinds of statistical methods. In this section, we present
a summary of the detected DMCs and the heatmaps of top significant DMCs
(reduced to 3000 if more are detected) for each group comparison.

### Summary

For each comparison, the table presents the compared groups, the number
of input sites (after filtering), the number of significant DMCs (both
hyper- and hypo-methylated) and the result’s filename. The filenames can
be used to download the data from the [Downloads](#downloads) section.

<kbd style='border: 3px solid #9ecff7;'><img src="../images/MethylSeq/Advanced/04.DMC_summary.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></kbd>

### Heatmap

This section shows the heatmaps of methylation values for the DMCs
detected in each comparison. The heatmaps are organized in a slideshow
and one can click the buttons at the bottom to access different ones.

In each heatmap, the title at the top shows the groups under comparison
and the number of DMCs used (if more than 3000 DMCs detected, then only
top 3000 will be used). The dengrograms at the top and left show the
clustering of samples and sites, respectively. The clusterings were
computed using hierarchical clusterings with Eucleadian distances.

<kbd style='border: 3px solid #9ecff7;'><img src="../images/MethylSeq/Advanced/05.DMC_heatmap.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></kbd>

## DMRs

DMRs stand for differential methylated regions. They can also be
detected by using various kinds of statistical methods. This section has
a similar structure as that of [DMCs](#dmcs), so one can find a summary
table as well as heatmaps for top DMRs.

### Summary

For each comparison, the table presents the compared groups, the number
of input sites (after filtering), the number of significant DMRs (both
hyper- and hypo-methylated) and the result’s filename. The filenames can
be used to download the data from the [Downloads](#downloads) section.

Note that many DMR statistical methods, such as DSS, don’t compute P
values, and thus no adjusted *P* values are computed.

<kbd style='border: 3px solid #9ecff7;'><img src="../images/MethylSeq/Advanced/06.DMR_summary.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></kbd>

### Heatmap

This section shows the heatmaps of methylation values for the DMRs
detected in each comparison. Again, only top 3000 DMRs are presented.
The methylation value of each DMR in each sample is computed as follows:

![\\frac{ \\sum\_{\\text{sites in DMR}} {\#methylated} }{ \\sum\_{\\text{sites in DMR}}{\#total} }](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=%5Cfrac%7B%20%5Csum_%7B%5Ctext%7Bsites%20in%20DMR%7D%7D%20%7B%23methylated%7D%20%7D%7B%20%5Csum_%7B%5Ctext%7Bsites%20in%20DMR%7D%7D%7B%23total%7D%20%7D "\frac{ \sum_{\text{sites in DMR}} {#methylated} }{ \sum_{\text{sites in DMR}}{#total} }")

where
![\#total](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=%23total "#total")
and
![\#methylated](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=%23methylated "#methylated")
provide the numbers of total and methylated reads at each site,
respectively.

Similarly, the dengrograms were computed using hierarchical clusterings
with Eucleadian distances.

<kbd style='border: 3px solid #9ecff7;'><img src="../images/MethylSeq/Advanced/07.DMR_heatmap.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></kbd>

### Functional enrichment

This section shows the results of functional enrichment analysis of
DMR-overlapped genes using the platform
[g:Profiler](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost). Briefly, the
platform maps the provided gene list to functional terms and finds the
enriched terms. The functional terms come from various databases
(GeneOntology, KEGG, CORUM, etc). In the plot, each dot represents one
functional term with the statistical significance shown on the y-axis
(in the format
![\\log\_{10}(\\text{adjusted P value})](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=%5Clog_%7B10%7D%28%5Ctext%7Badjusted%20P%20value%7D%29 "\log_{10}(\text{adjusted P value})")).

## Downloads

This section provides links to all kinds of downloadable results. At
present, the provided are DMCs, DMRs, and functional enrichment analysis
of DMR-overlapped genes.

<kbd style='border: 3px solid #9ecff7;'><img src="../images/MethylSeq/Advanced/09.downloads.png" width="95%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></kbd>

These files are normally tab- or comma- delimited, and compressed in
gzip. More details on the file formats are provided below:

### DMC files

The filename is named in the format of
*dms\_&lt;method&gt;.&lt;group1&gt;\_vs\_&lt;group2&gt;.tsv.gz*, where
*&lt;method&gt;* provides the statistical method (e.g., DSS), and
*&lt;group1&gt;* and *&lt;group2&gt;* are the compared group names.

Note that some columns are method-specific and thus omitted in output;
for example, the column ‘postprob.overThreshold’ is only available in
the output of DSS. The same principle applies to the DMR files.

### Functional enrichment of DMR overlapping genes files

These files are generated by
[gprofiler](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost), implemented in R
package
[gprofiler2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gprofiler2/index.html).
The files show the significant functional terms. One can find more
information on the analysis and the output format by visiting
[here](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/page/docs) and
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gprofiler2/vignettes/gprofiler2.html).

The filename is named in the format of
*func\_enrich.dmr\_&lt;method&gt;.&lt;group1&gt;\_vs\_&lt;group2&gt;.enrich\_analysis.gprofiler.tsv*,
where *&lt;method&gt;* provides the statistical method (e.g., DSS), and
*&lt;group1&gt;* and *&lt;group2&gt;* are the compared group names.
